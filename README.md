# 📊 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting medical insurance charges using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains demographic and health-related features such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and region. Multiple regression models are trained and compared to identify the best-performing algorithm.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Preprocess and encode categorical features
- Train multiple regression models
- Evaluate model performance using R² score and RMSE
- Predict insurance cost for new input data
